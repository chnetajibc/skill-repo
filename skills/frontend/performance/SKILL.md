# performance

Measure first, optimize second, prove third. Intuition-only optimization is a defect source.

## Activate when

- Perf requirements exist, regressions suspected, or bundle/render/DB costs questioned.

## Do NOT activate for

- Backend profiling specifics (see backend/*); SEO plumbing (see technical-seo).

## Procedure

1. Baseline: profile the actual bottleneck (CPU, memory, I/O, network, DB, bundle, render) with lab + field data; set Core Web Vitals targets (LCP/INP/CLS).
2. Fix the measured cause: N+1/waterfalls, rerender storms (memoization boundaries), bundle bloat (splitting, treeshaking), image weight (see media-assets), font/render blocking.
3. Re-measure on the same workload; record before/after numbers in the PR.
4. Guard: budgets + regression tests so the win survives; no speculative micro-optimizations.
5. Verify: targets met on representative devices/networks, no functional regression, numbers quoted.
